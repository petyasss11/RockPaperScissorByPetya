# The 'Rock' - 'Paper' - 'Scissors' Game


**Introduction to the Rock Paper Scissors Game**

Before building any new game, one needs to understand all about the game including its rules, inputs, and outputs, and all the necessary things.


**How to play the game?**

Rock paper scissors is one of the classic hand games we have been playing since we were all small kids. It is typically played between two players (can be played with more than two players as well) each one forming one of three shapes (rock, paper, and scissors) at the same time, with an extended hand.


**How to form hand gestures for the options?**

Rock is represented by a closed fist; paper is represented by a flat hand and the scissors are represented by forming a V (the popular peace signal). An illustration of the gestures is shown in the image below.

**Rules of the Game**

Although the coding part of the game can get a little complex the game rules are simple which are as follows:

1. Rock wins against scissors.

2. Scissors win against the paper.

3. Paper wins against the rock.
